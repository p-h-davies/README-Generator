## Description:
This project was designed to make creating README files easier and faster. Once the application is launched, you will be asked a set of questions in your terminal, which have been written to produce a high quality README file. Once all the questions have been answered, a fully prepared, professional README.md will appear in the application's 'Develop' folder, and you'll be able to move this file to your code folder/repository. 

To view how this application runs, watch the video below (this example has been performed using Git Bash, however, you are free to use another terminal application).

<video src="Develop/assets/application-recording.mp4" controls title="Title"></video>

## Installation:
To use this application, you will need to install Node.js and ensure you have a Terminator emulator Software installed (such as Terminal for Mac, or Bash for Windows). You will also need a code editor, such as VS code, to view and edit the provided README code.

## Usage:
To use, navigate to the 'Develop' folder through your terminal and type 'node index.js'. Then, simply answer the questions which appear. Once all of these have been answered, you will see a 'Success!' message appear and a README, with your entered data, will appear in the 'Develop' folder. You can then move this file to your code folder and you're all set!
